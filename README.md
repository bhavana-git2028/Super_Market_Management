The Project Online Grocery Shopping deals with the automation of shopping It includes both sales and purchase of items. 
The project Online Grocery Shopping is developed with the objective of making the system reliable, easier, fast, and more informative. 
There is a lot ofreasofor the introduction of this project. In the manual System, there are number ofinefficiencies that a salesperson faces. 
Large records-books have to be maintained where relevant and irrelevant information has to be stored which is very untidy and clumsy process.
But our System reduces paper works. On the other hand, there are many inherent problems that exist in any manual system. Usually, they lack efficiency. 
Less efficiency has a great impact on the productivity of any human being keeping the data up-to-date.
The different modules included in our project are administrative module, employee module, purchase module, sales module and billing module. 
Administrator allocates unique username and password to the employees. 
Each employee can log with the help of his/her unique id and password. 
Purchase and Sales module contains all the purchase and sales details. 
All the payment details will be shown in the Billing module.
